# anomaly-detection-in-traffic-videos-using-opencv--python
This system will identify the violation in traffic rules at traffic junctions using the cctv footage obtained at different traffic junctions with the help of  multilevel hdp and guassian process with active learning and opencv python.

As we all know the ccv footage obtained from different important places is kept ideal without any use until any incident has happend. After the occurence of the incident like atm theft, chain snatching and traffic rules violation at the junctions which will ultimatley lead to an accident the police man will go through a tremduous amount of video footage to find the cause, instead doing this we can identify the anomalies mentioned above using computer vision and python. Which will reduce the hectic job of watching the cctv footage by man. It can also be converted to real-time solving problem by using buzz system when ever the system finds an abnormality.
